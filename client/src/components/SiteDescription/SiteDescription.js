          Welcome to Cup of Sugar! Cup of Sugar is a Twin Cities based peer-to-peer rental platform where users can both lend and borrow various items and
          products. While allowing product owners to earn a return on rentable items, renters can easily borrow products at
          affordable rates without having to pay retail prices.
        
          Lend and borrow unused items locally, or earn easy money from products laying around your home and garage.
