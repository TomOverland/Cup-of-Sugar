          Welcome to Cup of Sugar! Cup of Sugar is a Twin Cities based peer-to-peer rental platform where users can both lend and borrow various items and
          products. While allowing product owners to earn a return on rentable items, renters can easily borrow products at
          affordable rates without having to pay retail prices.
        <br />
          Lend and borrow unused items locally, or earn easy money from products laying around your home and garage.
